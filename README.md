Brain Evoked Response Qualification Using Multi-Set Consensus Clustering: Toward Single-trial EEG Analysis
# Objective
Single-trial EEG data encapsulates repetitive neural information about the brain's neurological activity. Due to its crucial role, this becomes particularly significant when developing a computational data-driven model to capture brain dynamics from many similar datasets. While conventional EEG cluster analysis, notably EEG microstate analysis, has seen extensive investigation in clinical (Khanna et al., 2015; Lehmann et al., 2005; Nishida et al., 2013) and cognitive (Britz & Michel, 2011; Caldara et al., 2004; Ruggeri et al., 2019) neuroscience, studies, the prevailing approach of averaging trials to derive template maps (canonical microstate classes) from grand average ERP data can obscures essential nuances of individual neural processes. This study seeks to establish an effective clustering model based on multi-set consensus clustering and assess its reliability through error evaluation of scoring results. In addition, individualizing the proposed model in subject resolution to identify the brain-evoked response of the subjects.

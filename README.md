Brain Evoked Response Qualification Using Multi-Set Consensus Clustering: Toward Single-trial EEG Analysis
# Objective
Single-trial EEG data encapsulates repetitive neural information about the brain's neurological activity. Due to its crucial role, this becomes particularly significant when developing a computational data-driven model to capture brain dynamics from many similar datasets. While conventional EEG cluster analysis, notably EEG microstate analysis, has seen extensive investigation in clinical (Khanna et al., 2015; Lehmann et al., 2005; Nishida et al., 2013) and cognitive (Britz & Michel, 2011; Caldara et al., 2004; Ruggeri et al., 2019) neuroscience, studies, the prevailing approach of averaging trials to derive template maps (canonical microstate classes) from grand average ERP data can obscures essential nuances of individual neural processes. This study seeks to establish an effective clustering model based on multi-set consensus clustering and assess its reliability through error evaluation of scoring results. In addition, individualizing the proposed model in subject resolution to identify the brain-evoked response of the subjects.

# Methods
In this study, initiating with a masking step, we excluded the trials that exhibited no or low correlation with the identified component from grand average ERP data. We retained a minimum of 50% of trials, adjusting the correlation threshold (e.g., >0.40) as necessary. To this end, consensus clustering was used to select each subject's trials. Thereby, a multi-set consensus clustering was then utilized to select each subject's trials, facilitating the exploration of correlated brain responses within individual trials. After obtaining subject-specific clustering results, a modified time window determination method was applied to explore a representative cluster map of the potential of interest. In order to standardize evaluation (Franceschiello et al., 2022; Luck et al., 2021), a bootstrapping procedure was conducted incorporating analytical and bootstrapped scores in the proposed pipeline. The pipeline was evaluated on real data derived from a visual oddball paradigm experiment (Kappenman et al., 2021) to compute scores for identifying the P3 component. We tested scores including mean amplitude magnitude, the properties of the time window (start, end, and duration), the inner similarity of the time window, and spatial correlation between the template map and the mean topographical map within the time window. To assess result reliability, a bootstrapping procedure subjected the calculated scores to 1000 iterations.
# Results and Conclusions
The study successfully demonstrated that the ERP of interest can be explored from EEG single trials, uncovering the contribution of the cognitive response in individual resolution. The identified P3 component showcased an average spatial correlation of 0.65 across most subjects. Bootstrapping and analytical results revealed that the proposed method provides reasonable clustering results according to the tested scores. Ultimately, our findings establish a confident understanding of individual-level cognitive contributions to the group-level cognitive response, substantiating the utility of the devised approach.

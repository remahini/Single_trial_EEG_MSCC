# Single_trial_EEG_MSCC
# Objective
Single-trial EEG data holds repetitive neural information about the brainâ€™s neurological activity, which is particularly important when creating a computational model to capture brain dynamics from similar datasets. Traditional EEG cluster analysis, especially EEG microstate analysis, has been extensively researched in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, the common practice of averaging trials to derive template maps from grand average ERP data may overlook important details of individual neural processes. This study aims to develop an effective clustering model based on multi-set consensus clustering and evaluate its reliability through error evaluation of scoring results.
